This is my personal website, which contains a variety of things that I've been involved with.

The website is designed to easily place an item into a category through a JSON file in `items/`. Then the controller grabs those items and places it onto a timeline.

Icons come from [materialdesignicons.com](https://materialdesignicons.com/) and
from [simpleicons.org](https://simpleicons.org/).
